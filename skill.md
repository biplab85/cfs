# Claude AI – UI/UX Design Skill Prompt
## Project: Chilli Flakes Studio Podcast Website

Prompt:

Act as a senior professional UI/UX designer and brand strategist.
Design a modern, one-page static website for a podcast media brand called “Chilli Flakes Studio” (Sydney-based podcast for the South Asian diaspora).

This is NOT a service business.
The purpose of the website is to:

- Showcase featured guests (public figures, cricketers, musicians, professionals)
- Highlight channel statistics and global reach
- Promote podcast episodes (YouTube & Meta platforms)
- Communicate mission and credibility

⚠️ All content (text, guest names, statistics, quotes) will come dynamically from a single file called content.tsx.  
Design must assume data-driven rendering (no hardcoded text in layout).

## Design Goals:
- Bold, professional, media-style design
- Youthful but trustworthy
- Optimized for mobile and desktop
- High visual impact with strong typography

## Required Sections (design each section with layout + UI components):

### 1. Hero Section
- Podcast branding and tagline
- Background image or video overlay
- CTA buttons: Watch on YouTube, Follow on Facebook

### 2. About the Channel
- Short story of Chilli Flakes Studio
- Mission statement

### 3. Channel Statistics (Strong visual emphasis)
Cards or animated counters for:
- Facebook followers (13K+)
- Total views (1.5M+)
- YouTube subscribers (1.2K+)
- Global audience (Bangladesh, Sydney, India, Pakistan, Canada, UK)

### 4. Featured Guests (Main focus)
Grid or slider of guest cards with:
- Photo
- Name
- Role
- Hover effect with short bio or episode link

### 5. Guest Gallery / Media Wall
- Masonry or responsive grid of guest photos & podcast screenshots

### 6. Podcast Episodes
Video cards with:
- Thumbnail
- Title
- Short description

### 7. Mission & Values
Bold typography section with quote:  
“Bold conversations that matter, dialogues that spark change.”

### 8. Social Media Presence
- Platform icons with follower counts
- Embedded YouTube or Facebook preview

### 9. Call To Action (CTA)
Buttons:
- Be our next guest
- Follow & Subscribe

### 10. Footer
- Brand info
- Social links
- Copyright

## UI/UX Requirements:
- Suggest layout structure (grid, cards, sliders)
- Include micro-interactions (hover effects, scroll reveal, fade-in animations)
- Typography recommendations (Google Fonts)
- Accessibility (good contrast, readable font sizes)
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Color & Theme (Strict):
Use a Black & Red color palette only for the entire website.

- Primary Background: Black / near-black (#0B0B0B / #111111)
- Primary Accent: Chilli Red (#E10600 / #FF1E1E)
- Text Color: White / light gray
- Secondary accents: Dark red gradients and subtle glow effects

Design style should feel:
- Bold
- Cinematic
- Podcast / media brand
- High contrast and professional

Use gradients (black → dark red) for:
- Hero section
- Statistics section
- CTA buttons

Avoid multi-color palettes.  
Keep consistency using only black, red, and neutral gray tones.

## Technology Constraints:
Design must be implementable using:
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Swiper.js or Framer Motion for animations

## Output Format:
- Section-wise headings (Hero, About, Stats, Guests, etc.)
- Bullet points under each section
- For every section describe:
  - Layout
  - UI components
  - Interactions
  - Visual style

Do NOT include Services or FAQ sections.  
Focus on storytelling, guests, and statistics.  
Think like a modern podcast brand website designer.  
Ensure the design works with dynamic content from content.tsx.
